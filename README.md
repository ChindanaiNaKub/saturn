1. **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**: Go to your repository Settings → Pages
3. **Set Source**: Choose "GitHub Actions" as the source
4. **Automatic Deployment**: The included GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your site when you push to the main branch
