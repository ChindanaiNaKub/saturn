# Project overview
You are building a Portable Game Notation (PGN) Chess Reader and Editor Website, where users can upload and analyze their games pgn with this website include some chess engines to help user analysis just like lichess.org, chessable.com or even chess.com analysis that let user port but make it better.

You will be using NextJs, shadcn, tailwind, Lucid icon



# Core functionalities
1. PGN Upload/Input:
   - Upload PGN file: Allow users to directly upload PGN files from their local machine.
   - Paste PGN text: Provide a text area where users can paste PGN data (single games or multiple games).
   - Load from URL: Allow loading PGN from a given URL.

2. Interactive Chessboard Display:
   - Visual representation: Display the chess game on a clear, interactive chessboard.
   - Move navigation: Allow users to step through moves forward and backward using buttons, arrow keys, or a move list.
    Variations: Clearly show and allow navigation through variations and sub-variations present in the PGN.
    Piece movement animation: (Optional but highly desirable) Animate piece movements on the board for better visualization.
    Board orientation: Allow users to flip the board (White on bottom vs. Black on bottom).

3. PGN Information Display:
    Game headers: Display essential PGN tag pairs such as:
        Event: Name of the event.
        Site: Location of the event.
        Date: Date of the game.
        Round: Round number.
        White: Name of the White player.
        Black: Name of the Black player.
        Result: Result of the game (1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2, *).
        And potentially other common tags like ECO (Encyclopedia of Chess Openings code), WhiteElo/BlackElo, FEN (if starting from a custom position).
    Move list with algebraic notation: Present the game moves in a clear, readable algebraic notation.
    Comments and annotations: Display any comments, Numerical Annotation Glyphs (NAGs like !, ?, !!, ??), and other annotations included in the PGN.

4. Basic Analysis Tools:
    Legal move highlighting: Highlight legal moves when a piece is selected (if board interaction is enabled).
    Last move highlighting: Clearly indicate the last move played on the board.
    Engine integration (local or cloud): For more advanced readers, integrating a chess engine (like Stockfish) to provide:
        Current position evaluation.
        Best moves and principal variations.
        Error/blunder detection.
5. User Interface and Experience:
    Responsive design: The website should be usable on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    Clear and intuitive layout: Easy to understand and navigate.
    Performance: Fast loading and smooth interaction, even with large PGN files.
    Error handling: Gracefully handle malformed or invalid PGN input.
6. Download/Export Functionality:
    Download PGN: Allow users to download the currently viewed game as a PGN file (useful for editing or sharing).
    (Optional) Export to FEN: Allow exporting the current board position as a FEN string.
7. Import / Export from famous chess website (chess.com, lichess.org)
    Direct PGN Export from your site to their format 
    "Import from Player's Archive / username"
